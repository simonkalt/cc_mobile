  "additional_instructions_text": "⚠️ CRITICAL SYSTEM INSTRUCTION - MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY ⚠️\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND USAGE RULES:\n\nSTEP 1: Extract contact information from the resume document:\n   - Email address (if present in resume)\n   - Phone number (if present in resume)\n   - Street address (if present in resume)\n   - City (if present in resume)\n   - State (if present in resume)\n   - Zip code (if present in resume)\n\nSTEP 2: Use ONLY actual extracted values in the cover letter:\n   - If email exists in resume → Use the actual email address\n   - If phone exists in resume → Use the actual phone number\n   - If city/state/zip exist in resume → Use the actual values\n\nSTEP 3: CRITICAL - NEVER use placeholders or template markers:\n   - NEVER write: [Email], [EMAIL], [Phone], [PHONE], [PHONE], [City], [State], [Zip], [Address]\n   - NEVER write: Phone: [PHONE] or Email: [EMAIL]\n   - NEVER write labels without values (e.g., 'Phone:' with no number, 'Email:' with no address)\n   - If a value does NOT exist in the resume → Omit it completely (no label, no placeholder, nothing)\n\nSTEP 4: Format examples (use ONLY if values exist in resume):\n   - Email exists: 'Email: actual@email.com'\n   - Phone exists: 'Phone: (555) 123-4567'\n   - Both exist: 'Phone: (555) 123-4567 | Email: actual@email.com'\n   - Address exists: 'City, State Zip' or full address\n   - If email doesn't exist: Do NOT write 'Email:' at all\n   - If phone doesn't exist: Do NOT write 'Phone:' at all\n\nSTEP 5: Final check before output:\n   - The cover letter must be complete and ready to use\n   - NO placeholder text of any kind\n   - NO template markers\n   - NO labels without corresponding values\n   - Only include contact information that actually exists in the resume\n\n---\n\nAdditional Instructions:\nUse multiple fonts,sizes and colors. Make my name huge. \n\n---\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When generating HTML, apply these Print/Export Settings:\n- Font Family: Calibri\n- Font Size: 16.799999999999997pt (use this exact value in your HTML inline styles, e.g. font-size: 16.799999999999997pt)\n- Line Height: 1.15\n- Page Size: 8.5\" x 11\"\n- Margins: Top 1\", Right 1\", Bottom 1\", Left 1\"\nApply these settings as inline CSS styles in the HTML output to ensure proper formatting. Make sure to use font-size: 16.799999999999997pt in your HTML elements.\n\nHTML STRUCTURE FOR PRINT/PDF (required for correct page breaks and formatting):\n- Output full HTML with all formatting: use <p> for every paragraph, <h1>/<h2>/<h3> for headings, and apply inline font-family, font-size, and line-height per the Print/Export settings above. Do not output plain text or minimal HTML—every paragraph must be in a <p> tag.\n- Output a single root <div> containing only block elements: <p>, <div>, <ul>, <ol>. Do not put all text in one giant div with spans or inline elements.\n- Use <p> for every paragraph of body text so page breaks do not split mid-paragraph.\n- Use <h1>, <h2>, or <h3> for any headings (not inline or spans).\n- Do NOT set width, min-width, or max-width in px, vw, or fixed units on any element. Do not use style=\"width: 800px\" or width: 100vw.\n- Do NOT use large margin or padding (e.g. 2in, 100px). Use small values like 0.5em or 1em only if needed between elements.\n- REQUIRED: Wrap content in <div class=\"letter-section\"> so the PDF engine (WeasyPrint) keeps chunks together. Use exactly TWO letter-sections: (1) one section that contains BOTH the salutation (e.g. \"Dear...\") AND the body (all main paragraphs together)—do NOT put the salutation in its own letter-section or you will get an unwanted page break after \"Dear...\"; (2) one section for the closing (e.g. \"Sincerely,\" and signature block). This prevents a page break right after the salutation.\n- For a forced page break use <div class=\"page-break\"></div>. Do not use inline page-break styles.\n- Return only the HTML fragment (one root div with content); no inline page-break CSS.\n- Preserving custom fonts and sizes: inline font-family, font-size, and line-height on elements are preserved in the Print Preview PDF (backend uses printProperties as baseline and does not override them). You may use them for emphasis (e.g. slightly larger applicant name or heading)."
